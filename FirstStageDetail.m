msgbox([{'In this stage rectification is made !!'} ;{''}; {'* All Phases passes throug a Diod will allows only positive part of the wave blocking the negative pasrt'};{''};{'* In Second Stage Negative part of Wave is also added giving a Full Wave Rectification'};{''};{'*In last step a Capacitor is attached in parallel which store charge and give feedback whenever voltages decreases... By apropriate capacitance of capacitor voltage fall is minimized giving nearlly a pure DC wave '}])
