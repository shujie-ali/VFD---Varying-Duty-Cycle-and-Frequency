# VFD---Varying-Duty-Cycle-and-Frequency
This was my freshmen project in Computational Problem Solving teach by Dr.Sohaib Khan and Dr.Murtaza Taj in LUMS 2013.

Work done on the project:
I did the following  to make my project;
•	Have showed true simulation of the VFD with high precision
•	Have portrayed reality of power generation to the functioning of appliances through VFD in MATLAB 
•	Made a 3D motor to show the functioning of the appliances 
•	Divided my program into different scripts and functions.

For the above purposes I;
•	Made the flow sheet diagram of my project.
•	Made the Functions of every hardware in it.
•	Tried to show iteration in a time lapse of minimum range 8.0e^-4.
•	Filled many pages in order to find correct equations.
•	I got advice from Dr.Amir Rashid (EE dep.) for Motor who suggested me 'Stephen J. Chapmen.
•	Spent hours in research of specific commands.
•	Got advice from T.A(which was really helping).
What I Learned:

I learned;
•	To divide problem in small pieces.
•	To make different types of functions and scripts.
•	How to work on a specific problem without any initial conditions provided.
•	Learned new commands on MATLAB which are yet to be taught in our course
